# Scalability tests

This repo collects code, instructions and results for scalability tests on the Rancher product family.

## Usage

See the [docs](docs) directory for a list of tests and their usage specifics.

## Common Troubleshooting

### k3d: cluster not created

If you get this error from `terraform apply`:
```
Error: Failed Cluster Start: Failed to add one or more agents: Node k3d-... failed to get ready: error waiting for log line `successfully registered node` from node 'k3d-st-upstream-agent-0': stopped returning log lines: node k3d-... is running=true in status=restarting
```

And `docker logs` on the node container end with:
```
kubelet.go:1361] "Failed to start cAdvisor" err="inotify_init: too many open files"
```

Then you might need to increase inotify's maximum open file counts via:
```
echo 256 > /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances
echo "fs.inotify.max_user_instances = 256" > /etc/sysctl.d/99-inotify-mui.conf
```

### Kubernetes cluster unreachable

If you get this error from `terraform apply`:
```
â”‚ Error: Kubernetes cluster unreachable: Get "https://upstream.local.gd:6443/version": dial tcp 127.0.0.1:6443: connect: connection refused
```

SSH tunnels might be broken. Reopen them via:
```shell
./config/open-tunnels-to-upstream-*.sh
```

### Terraform extended logging

In case Terraform returns an error with little context about what happened, use the following to get more complete debugging output:
```shell
export TF_LOG=debug
```

## Tips

### Use k3d targeting a remote machine running the Docker daemon

Use the following command to point to a remote Docker host:
```shell
export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://remotehost:remoteport
```

Note that the host has to have TCP socket enabled, in addition or replacing the default Unix socket.

Eg. on SUSE OSs edit the `/etc/sysconfig/docker` file as root and add or edit the following line:
```
DOCKER_OPTS="-H unix:///var/run/docker.sock -H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375"
```

If you access the Docker host via SSH, you might want to forward the Docker port along with any relevant ports to access Rancher and the clusters' Kubernetes APIs, for example:

```shell
ssh remotehost -L 2375:localhost:2375 -L 8443:localhost:8443 $(for KUBEPORT in $(seq 6445 1 6465); do echo " -L ${KUBEPORT}:localhost:${KUBEPORT}" ; done | tr -d "\n")
```

### Use custom-built Rancher images on k3d

When using `k3d`, change `RANCHER_IMAGE_TAG` and if an image with the same tag is found it will be added to relevant clusters.

This is useful during Rancher development to test Rancher changes on k3d clusters.

## Passing custom Terraform variables

Terraform variables can be overridden using `TERRAFORM_VAR_FILE` environment variable, to point to a [`.tfvars` file](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#variable-definitions-tfvars-files). The variable should contain a path to the file in json or tfvars format.
For example, for the `ssh` module, nodes' ip addresses, login name, etc. can be overridden cas follows:

```shell
export TERRAFORM_WORK_DIR=terraform/main/ssh
export TERRAFORM_VAR_FILE=terraform/examples/ssh.tfvars.json
./bin/setup.mjs
./bin/run_tests.mjs
./bin/teardown.mjs
```

Example files can be found in [terraform/examples].
